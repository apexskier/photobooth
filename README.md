## Dev Setup

numpy is slow to download

```sh
sudo apt install libraw-dev # supports pyraw
```

## Usage

- Ensure Camera > 1 > "Quality" is not set to RAW
- Ensure Toolbox > 4 > "USB Connection" is set to "PC Remote"

- If the printer sleeps, turn it back on. It will process jobs sent to it while asleep
- If the printer runs out of ink/paper, replace both

- When started, light will blink on and off while initalizing
- Light will slowly pulse brighter and dimmer when ready
- Light will flash 5 times as a countdown for each photo
- Light will pulse on and off quickly while processing
- Light will flash quickly when complete, then resume slow pulsing

## TODO

- Upload square photo for download?
- Camera I/O kinks?
- Printer gamma adjustment?

- Light stand and backdrop
